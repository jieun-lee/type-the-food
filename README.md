# Type the Food
Game made with JavaScript that involves typing food names as fast as possible.

### Scenario
You are a server at a popular restaurant.
Before the day begins, you will be given a list of food items that are sold at your restaurant.

When customers come in, they will order various food items, but only some of them will order food that is actually sold at your restaurant.
If it is sold at your restaurant, type the name of the food item before the customer cancels their order.
If it is not sold at your restaurant, click on the customer to reject their order.

After 1 minute, the day will end - if you have not made any mistakes, you will successfully move on to the next day/level, where two new menu items will have been added along with two additional customer seats.
